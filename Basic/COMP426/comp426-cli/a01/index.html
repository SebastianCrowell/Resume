                Xibalba is the realm of death and fear, where many heros and travelers must pass trials or encounter demons. 
                In Xibalba, there are 9 levels of the underworld that represent how deep as well as how scary they are.
                Often each level has one or many demons and gods that inhabit it, as shown on the right and a general theme.
                The best known god of all the levels is the god of the 9th level AH-PUCH (English:[Grinning God of Death]), ruler of MITNAL (English:[Mayan Hell]).
                He often appears in imagery with a corpse like body and a large owl headdress or headress with owl feathers.
                This likeness is seen in many burials, on pottery, on temples and in jewelry. 
                It is often accompanied by a mound of skulls, various weapons, or displays of magic and deceit.
                Because of how much AH-PUCH was shown in Mayan art, he even became a pop culture icon in some video games and movies, right next to the storm god.
                In addition to his ties to the owl and death, he is also associated with the number ten in Mayan culture.
                The other gods hold similar stories, of being bearers of plague, evil and death but his story is most well known.
                Otherwise, the demons and gods of Xibalba are mostly the reason for sacrifice in Mayan culture, the exception being the maize god.
                People are often sent into hell because of wrong doings to face judgement, but some go willing and wanting to earn various riches.
                Often those who are sent into the depths must defeat either one of or all of the demons in a game, most often, a ball game.
                If they lose, they lose their soul and often their head (to be used as a ball for all eternity) and are forced to endure tortue.
