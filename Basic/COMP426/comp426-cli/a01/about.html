        <h2>
            Why Mayan mythos?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Despite it being widely used and depicted in pop culture like Smite, League of Legends, World of Warcraft and many others, it happens to be quite interesting to see what people believed in so fanatically.

        <h3>
            Why pick such a morbid being?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Funny enough, this was one of the least bloody gods I could think of.
            He mostly dealt with those who were dead or going to die soon.
            When he wasn't dealing with one of those he did kill people though, using the number 10 and owls according to legend.

            Are you sure you know what you are writing about?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Mostly sure, I fact checked some of what I didn't remeber from my classes on the Olmecs, Mayans, and Aztecs.
            That said, I am in no way an expert and my interpretation or spelling could have been wrong.

            No, but if it did, it would be listed under the citations page.
