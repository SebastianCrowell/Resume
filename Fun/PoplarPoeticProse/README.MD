A fun little application built for image processing
-Construct a simple poem using the first two lines from the image and 
the rest from web-scraped rhymezone and poems of the form "roses are 
red, violets are blue"


Basic Function
-Take an image of one or more flowers
-Image is resized and parsed for shape
-Shape is matched to a flower
-Color within the shape is sampled and matched based on hue
-First two lines are constructed
-The flower's colors are used to find the endings of the next two lines 
from rhymezone
-The beginning part of the poems is filled using a randomized formula to 
decide if a noun, adjective, or predicate should be placed
