How to setup and run the programs:

-In order to run this, place the .exe for the version you want to run with the .txt files you want to run, the only requirement for text files is that they contain some number of colors followed by a blank line, some number of characters followed by a blank line and some number of relations between the states

-The program will prompt you on running it, from the command prompt window, to input a file, do not include a filepath ie. usTestFile.txt

-On completion of the search, the window will prompt the user to press enter (mostly so that the information can be looked at)

-For local search, if no solution is found it will display as much and not include a counter because it crashes for some god awful C reason

Version -> Backtracking is in DiffReadIn.exe while Local Search is in DiffLocal.exe

Running -> Running from the cmd window is start ProgramName.exe
