The first two files starting with NBA_ were used together. The .rar 
file is very large and can crash lower end computers if not careful. The 
three hw files are jupyter notebooks that were done in a group of 4, the 
people in the group are : Esteban A Leon, Pa Chia Thao, Gaurachandra 
Das, Sebastian R Crowell. If the notebook does not load, you can try 
reloading or clicking on raw to let it try and reload. If that still 
doesn't work you will need anaconda and pandas to access it locally.
